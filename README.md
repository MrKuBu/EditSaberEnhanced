![alt text](https://github.com/Ikeiwa/3D-beatsaber-song-editor/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true)
This is a fork of the EditSaber release 6v2 by Ikeiwa, all credits for the original Editor go to them.
It also includes a ton of features by squeaksies who took the time to merge our two versions together!

UPDATE: This version of the Editor is no longer in development, however Squeaksies picked up the torch and released a fork of this Editor which was since heavily improved. Check it out here:
